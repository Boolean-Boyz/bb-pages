# bb-pages — Boolean Boyz Frontend

The Boolean Boyz frontend, built as a GitHub Pages Jekyll site to support the **Friends of the Poway Library (FOPL)** web application. This repo is forked from the [Open Coding Society Pages starter](https://github.com/open-coding-society/pages) and customized for our class project.

## About This Project

This frontend was built by the Boolean Boyz team as part of an AP Computer Science Principles capstone project. It serves as the user-facing interface for the FOPL website, connecting to the [bb-flask](https://github.com/Boolean-Boyz/bb-flask) backend for all dynamic features. Future class cohorts are welcome and encouraged to build on this foundation.

The live site is available at: [fopl.opencodingsociety.com/home](https://fopl.opencodingsociety.com/home)

                                         3. 3. Open a pull request with a clear description of what you added or changed
                                           
                                            4. Use the existing pages as a style reference, and make sure your pages connect to the correct bb-flask API endpoints.
